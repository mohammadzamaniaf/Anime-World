#### Description:
  Anime World is a Mobile App designed and developed for anime lovers around the world to access their favorite content in their fingertips.

#### Why there is a need for this:
  Anime (Japanese style of 2D animations) is a very popular entertainment worldwide. There are currently more than 100 million animes fans around the world that are mostly teengers and youths. These fans constantly look for new and entertaining animes to watch and thus there are tons of websites out there who has made their job to introduce these animes to the fans. But most of these websites and apps seems to be not particularly well-designed. I have personally tested many anime websites and apps and sadly there is none you can enjoy using due to design problems they have. One of these famous websites is myanimelist that is also my favorite website that contains all kinds of information about animes and mangas. But I sometimes find it hard to use due to design problems and lack of interactivity and complexness. So I decided to download is mobile app but noticed that it wasn't an actual mobile app but rather a wrapper around the existing website causing me not to have a user-friendly experience. So, this was my motivation to create an app that is not only wholesome and has all kinds of info that you look for in a good app but also is well-designed and easy to use. So I created "Anime World" that uses the public api by "MyAnimeList" website so it loads the exact same data of "MyAnimeList" website but does is in a lot better way for fans to have a more premium experience.
